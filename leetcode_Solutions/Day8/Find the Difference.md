# Find the Difference
- ## Question:
>You are given two strings `s` and `t`.
>
>String `t` is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.
>
>Return the letter that was added to `t`.

- Example :

      Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
      Output: "e"
      Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.
      
- ## Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
        char c = 0;
        for(char cs : s) c ^= cs;
        for(char ct : t) c ^= ct;
        return c;
    }
};
```
